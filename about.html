<p> False Information v Fake News
Experts now recommend avoiding the term fake news, or at least limit its use, as the term fake news is closely associated with politics, and this association can unhelpfully narrow the focus of the issue.

Information overload and a general lack of understanding about how the internet works by people has also contributed to an increase in fake news or hoax stories. Social media sites can play a big part in increasing the reach of these type of stories.
